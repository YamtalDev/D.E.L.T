# Google Search Script
# Author: Tal Aharon
# License: GPL 2.x
#
# Purpose: Perform a Google search using the default web browser.
#
# Syntax: google <search_terms>
#
# Arguments:
#   - <search_terms>: The search terms to be used for the Google search. 
#                     Multiple search terms can be provided, separated by spaces.
#
# Description:
#   The `google` script allows you to perform a Google search using the 
#   default web browser on your system. It takes any number of search terms as 
#   command-line arguments and concatenates them with "%20" (which represents a 
#   space in URL encoding) to form a search query. The script then opens the 
#   default web browser to perform the search on Google.
#
# Command-line Options:
#   None
#
# Usage Examples:
#   1. Perform a basic Google search for a single term:
#      $ google "apple"
#
#   2. Perform a Google search with multiple terms:
#      $ google "best movies of 2023"
#
#   3. Search for specific information with multiple terms:
#      $ google "how to bake a cake"
#
#   4. Include special characters in the search:
#      $ google "python programming language tutorial"
#
# Notes:
#   - The script assumes that the user will provide search terms as command-line 
#     arguments.
#   - If a search term contains spaces, the script will handle it correctly by 
#     URL-encoding the spaces with "%20".
#   - The script relies on `xdg-open` (Linux), `open` (macOS), or `start` (Windows) 
#     to open the default web browser. Ensure that your system has one of these 
#     commands available in the system PATH for this functionality to work.
#   - If the script cannot open a web browser, it will display an error message 
#     prompting the user to manually perform the search.
#   - Use this script responsibly and respect Google's usage policies.
